# OhMyFood-Project
OpenClassrooms Project 2 on the Web Developer (Skills Bootcamp) Pathway

-------------Scenario-----------------

You have just been recruited at Ohmyfood as a junior developer. Congratulations!

Ohmyfood is a new startup that wants to make a name for itself in the restaurant business. The objective is to develop a 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to having a classic reservation system, customers will be able to select the dishes they want for their meal so that they are ready when they arrive. No more wait times in restaurants! You are one of the four lucky ones who have the chance to work on this project. The team is composed of:

Paul, the CTO of the future site...
Emily, the UX designer, recruited to create the site’s UI design...
Anissa, the sales representative in charge of canvassing the restaurants...
You, in charge of the development of the site.

-------------Design Brief---------------

Identity - Ohmyfood is an online food ordering company. Our concept allows users to compose their own menu and reduce waiting time in restaurants because they make their choice in advance. No more wasting time consulting the menu!

Proposition- We would like to offer our customers gastronomic restaurant menus. Initially developed in New York, we now want to extend our concept to the capital of gastronomy: Paris.

Positioning - We are placing ourselves in a niche market within the luxury restaurants of established cities. We want to be seen as a company offering high-quality services.

Target - Middle and upper class people who are connected and often in a hurry, wishing to taste quality products.

Objectives - ● Phase 1: Develop a site offering the menu of four great Parisian restaurants within 1 month ● Phase 2: Allow online booking and menu composition within 6 months

FONTS -

Logo and Titles: Shrikhand ... Text: Roboto

COLOURS -

Primary: #9356DC ... Secondary: #FF79DA ... Tertiary: #99E2D0

TECHNOLOGIES -

The development will have to be in CSS, without JavaScript. No framework should be used; however, Sass would be a plus. No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.

COMPATIBILITY -

As the target market is the connected and hurried population, the site will be developed using the mobile-first approach. For this reason, only mobile models will be made. On tablet and desktop, the site will have to responsively adapt, but these formats are not a priority, so the developer defines the layout. The pages will have to pass W3C validation in HTML and CSS without errors.

PAGE CONTENT -

● Homepage: Display the location of restaurants. Eventually, it will be possible to choose restaurants close to a certain place. A short presentation of the company. A section containing the four menus in the form of cards. When clicking on the card, the user is redirected to the menu page.

● Menu Pages (x4): Each containing a restaurant menu

● Header: The header is present on all pages. The home page contains the logo of the site. The menu pages contain a button to return to the home page.

● Footer: The footer is identical on all pages. When you click on Contact, a link to an email address is made.

ANIMATIONS (CSS ONLY NO JAVASCRIPT) - 

● Buttons: When hovering, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The
drop shadow should also be more visible. Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For that, a heart-shaped Like button is present on the model. When you click on it, it should fill up gradually. For this first version, the effect can appear on hovering on desktop instead of clicking.

● Home Page: When the application has more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. On thismock-up, we would like to have a preview of it. It will have to appear for 1 to 3
seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and use CSS animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined, so any proposal is welcome as long as it is consistent with the graphic charter.

● Menu Pages: When arriving on the page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight time lag. They may appear either one by one or by group Starter, Main course, and Dessert. An example of the expected effect is provided. The visitor can add the dishes he wishes to his order by clicking on them. A small checkmark will appear to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from right to left. For this first version, the effect can be displayed on hovering on desktop instead of clicking. If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with suspension points. An example of the expected effect is provided.
